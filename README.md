# Data Preprocessing and Search Pipeline

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the design of a modular data pipeline for **preprocessing** and **search/retrieval** tasks. The project highlights practical skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and implementing search strategies over structured and unstructured datasets.

## üìÇ Project Files
- **preprocessing.ipynb**  
  Implements data preprocessing and feature engineering. Includes:
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies)
  - Text and numerical feature preprocessing
  - Tokenization, normalization, and encoding
  - Exploratory analysis and visualization
  - Outputting a processed dataset ready for downstream tasks

- **search.ipynb**  
  Implements search and retrieval functionality over the preprocessed dataset. Includes:
  - Query preprocessing and normalization
  - Vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings)
  - Search algorithms (keyword search, semantic similarity, etc.)
  - Ranking and evaluation metrics
  - Examples of interactive queries

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Modular preprocessing pipeline for reproducibility
- Search functionality supporting keyword and semantic retrieval
- Visualization and exploratory steps for insights
- Jupyter notebook format for step-by-step execution and explanation
